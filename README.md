# Touhou Calendar

An ICS calendar file with Touhou Project character days and fan-celebrated dates. Subscribe in any calendar app (Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) to get yearly reminders.

## Download

Grab `touhou_calendar.ics` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).

## How It Works

A GitHub Actions workflow runs `main.py` to parse YAML day data and generate a standards-compliant ICS file. A new release is created automatically each year.

## Credits

Day data sourced from [TouhouCalendarBot](https://github.com/TouhouCalendar/TouhouCalendarBot) by the Touhou Calendar community.
